    Reads in Sudoku puzzle specifications from a file. The puzzles must be separated by one or more separator lines.
    A separator line is any line starting with a alpha-letter (a-z, A-Z) or the '#' symbol.
    The format for specifying each puzzle is flexible as long as:
      - The digits 1-9 specify a filled cell and the letter '.' (or the digit 0) an empty cell.
        The digits (and '.') are process in a left-to-right and top-to-bottom order, that is, the first digit (or
        '.') encountered specifies the value of the top-left most cell, the second, the top-second-leftmost, ...,
        and the last one the bottom-right-most cell.
      - There are exactly 81 cell values specified.
    The routine returns a list of puzzles. Each puzzle is represented as a list of 81 digits (0-9).
